Description: Package provides all necessary functions for BIOS735 final project.
              All functions assume a logistic regression model.
              Included are functions for LASSO and LASSO tuning parameter selection, Bayesian
              variable selection via SSVS, and Bayesian Prediction. Also available
              are functions to tune the Metropolis Hastings proposal standard deviation 
              for both the SSVS and Bayesian Prediction.
